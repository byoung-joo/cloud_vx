# cloud_vx

- This repository contains a collection of script and config files to run the Model Evaluation Tools (MET) verification software for a cloud-focused forecast verification.
- To facilitate ingestion of the various datasets, especially the gridded ones, we heavily leveraged a “python embedding” capability available since version 8.1 of MET.
- When using this feature, MET reads data as provided by a python script, greatly increasing MET’s flexibility and capabilities.
